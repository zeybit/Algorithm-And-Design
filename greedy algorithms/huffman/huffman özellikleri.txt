▪ Each character appears with some frequency in a text.
▪ A binary code assigns a string of 0s and 1s to each character in 
the alphabet.
▪ A binary code is prefix-free if no code is a prefix of any other.(karakter<-->değer)
▪ Any prefix-free binary code can be visualized as a binary tree with
the encoded characters stored at the leaves.
▪ The code word for any symbol is given by the path from the root to
the corresponding leaf; 0 for left, 1 for right.
▪ The length of a codeword for a symbol is the depth of the 
corresponding leaf.
▪ Fixed-length code: where a fixed-length code is assigned to each 
character.
▪ Variable-length code: can do considerably better than a fixedlength code, by giving frequent characters short codewords and
infrequent characters long codewords

Fixed-length : sıklığı farklı olsa bile her karaktere aynı uzunlukta bit
Variable-length : sıklığa göre değişir uzunluk ;sıklığı az olana uzun bit
