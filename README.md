<h2>sorting algorithms</h2>

<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
<p>A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.</p>
<h4>**PseudoCode**</h4>
<h4>**Phyton Code**</h4>

<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
<p>Another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the already sorted part of the array.</p>
<h4>**Phyton Code**</h4>
<h4>**PseudoCode**</h4>

<h3>Merge Sort</h3>
<p>A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.
</p>
<h4>**Phyton Code**</h4>
<h4>**PseudoCode**</h4>

<h3>Quick Sort</h3>
<p>A divide and conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.</p>
<h4>**Phyton Code**</h4>
<h4>**PseudoCode**</h4>

<h2>Greedy Algorithms</h2>
<p>Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution. They are generally straightforward to implement and can find solutions that are close to optimal for many problems. However, they do not guarantee finding the globally optimal solution in every case.</p>
<h4>**Logic of Greedy algorithms**</h4>
<h3>Huffman </h3>
<p>A data compression algorithm that creates an optimal prefix-free binary tree (called a Huffman tree) from the frequencies of the characters in a text, where more frequent characters are represented using fewer bits in the encoding.</p>
<h4>**Phyton Code**</h4>
<h4>**PseudoCode**</h4>

<h3>Job Scheduling Problem</h3>
<p>Refers to various scheduling problems where a set of tasks or jobs need to be scheduled on a set of resources, such as machines or processors, to optimize some criteria like minimizing completion time, maximizing resource utilization, etc.</p>

<h4>**PseudoCode**</h4>
<h4>**Proof**</h4>
